# Catch up!

## What did you think of the Rails week

- Testing with Rails
- Nice break of lectures
- Solve before breakout / lectures is fun
- Ruby is fun (stockholm syndrome?)

## What is still mystifying ?

- form_for vs form_tag
- MVC split

MVC ->
Model : Representation of a concept (thing / person / ...)
View : How to view info and possible interactions with the concept
Controller : Actions that can be done on the model
